LOCAL ALIGNMENT
The main program you want to run is “locAL.py”.

This program takes in a file with two sequences to be aligned. User can specifically modify match/mismatch/indel scores with -m, -s, -d flags respectively.
The program will output the best local alignment’s score and the length. To see the actual alignment between the two strings, use ‘-a’ flag.

For more information on how to run the program, use “—help” for documentation.
